# THE PROJECT CODE AND DATASET IS AVAILABEL IN THE REPOSITORY.
# ABSTARCT
This project is mainly about prediecting whether the person will be effected by heart disease or not based on some physical parameters.
This project is carried out with the help heart dataset from kaggale. In this project, 11 supervisied classifers are been implemeneted for predciting hear disease. The results of the classifiers with their performance metrics is show below :

# Further the performance of the classifiers can be improved with the help of hyperparameter tuing which was already discussed in previous projects. Once go to previous projects and follow the steps for tuning the models for better performance.
